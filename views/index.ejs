        <p>In 2019 we became a food allergy family. My son suffered a server allergic reaction to peanut butter while traveling back from a family vaction.  Every meal we prepare and consume since has been filled with anxiety about his food allergies.  I have created this app with my son and other food allegy friends in mind.  Having a quick go to app that saves your favorite "safe" recipes was the goal. </p>
